Think like a hiring manager - highlight what you have in your experience.

A lot of data science is cleaning up other people's messes.  Know what you're getting into.

Data science also has a lot of debate.  Similar to climate change, where even though there is plenty of evidence people debate endlessly.

If you are not already in the field, necessary to have a competitive resume.

3 broad categories in the discipline, skill sets and types are different:
* Data Science - attached to engineering or product team, production code (if something breaks on a website they will call you).  Delivering software.  Possibly need Ph.D.  An IT discipline.  Need to repeat same procedure over and over.  Work on automation.
* Business Analytics - usually attached to finance, marketing, or sales business unit - which borrower will default?  Delivering insight, problem solving.  Do not want business analytics to always follow the same path.  Need to attack problems from different viewpoints.  More creativity.
* Data IT - more like back office function, data flows, processing, warehousing.  Automate everything.

If you are open to everything, you are hurting yourself.  Need a resume which speaks to a particular field.  Pick one of the above.

Big battle is to get resume into hands of hiring manager.  Bypass headhunters, HR, machine filtering.  Comments assume resume is in front of human being.  If your path to job goes thru HR, you are doomed.  If your resume is not in front of the hiring manager, you are 90% doomed.

Hiring managers are busy people.  Take less than 10 seconds - 30 seconds per resume.
Generally read top to bottom.
Highlight all relevant things.  Ask yourself - am I writing this for future boss or current boss?

In newspaper world, put all important things at top.  First section will get read...second section maybe, bottom, no.  Same thing with bullet points.  Optimization of space.  Make it easy for the hiring manager.

Attract attention by bolding, underlining, larger font size.  Don't use all caps.  People think you might be yelling.

Resume is not documentation - don't document your life.  Not a perforamcne review, either.  CV is response to a specific request for proposal (RFP) - a job.  Make it a personal branding statement.  Science and tech don't feel comfortable in marketing or sales.  It's a creative exercise.  Interpret the past in a relevant way.

Telling people who you want to be, not what you were.  Brand yourself.  Speak to your future boss.  Skills must appeal to future boss.

[Critique of my own resume.  You might want to adjust some language - objective to better reflect targeted job.
"Better understand the world thru data" is more like a socially beneficial mission.  Companies want to make money.]

Need to optimize relevant to irrelevant ratio.  Economy of information.

Don't use acronyms which only mean something to your current boss.

Frame bullet points for next hiring manager.

Do not use like, other, etc. as terms - discloses that you might not understand or casts doubt that you did the project properly.

Talking about results means you care about results, but they need to be relevant to future boss.  Contextualize by comparing metrics vs company or industry.

For data analytics, need to relate to:
* Data collection and cleaning
* Analysis
* Reporting
* Optimization
* Modeling
* Chasing down data / solving problems

Look at the job posting as an RFP and adapt your resume to that.

Need to have hard skills in this world, and need to list/point them out.  Must be relevant to the future job, not the current job.  Cut the noise.

Key thing you want to convey in the top branding section is that you are qualified and better than the next guy.  Distinguish yourself from classmates who have done the same projects.

#### Question and answer segment

Q.  What do you think about certification?
A.  Shows that the person really wants it.  Tells me something.

Do research on hiring managers.  Ideally diverse thinking people get together to form data science teams.  The reality is like hires like.  Computer science rarely hire non-CS people.  Statisticians favor other statisticians.

Q.  Which of the three fields are most stable?
A.  Business analytics is more secure than data IT, which is more secure than data science.  Business analytics has been around for a long time and is closest to the C-level.  They report key performance indicators (KPI's) to the C-suite.  Management is not going to fire the person delivering reports to C level.  They may ax a data science team which is working on speculative or seemingly inconsequential things.
