Think like a hiring manager - highlight what you have in your experience.

A lot of data science is cleaning up other people's messes.  Debate is messy like climate change.

When not already in the field necessary to have a competitive resume.

3 broad categories
* Data Science - attached to engineering or product team, production code (if something breaks on a website they will call you).  Delivering software.
* Business Analytics - finance, marketing, sales business unit - which borrower will default?  Delivering insight.
* Data IT - more like back office function, data flows, processing, warehousing

If you are open to everything, you are hurting yourself.  Need a resume which speaks to a particular field.

Big battle is to get resume into hands of hiring manager.  Bypass headhunters, HR, machines.  Comments assume resume is in front of human being.  If your path to job goes thru HR, you are doomed.

Hiring managers are busy people.  Take less than 10 seconds - 30 seconds.
Read top to bottom.
Highlight all relevant things.
Am I writing this for future boss or current boss?

In newspaper world, put all important things at top.  First section will get read...second section maybe, bottom, no.  Same thing with bullet points.  Optimization of space.

Attract attention by bolding, underlining, larger font size.

Don't use all caps.  People think you might be yelling.

Resume is not documentation - don't document life.  Not perforamcne review.  CV is response to RFP - a job.  Personal branding statement.  Science and tech don't feel comfortable in marketing or sales.  It's a creative exercise.  Interpret past in a relevant way.

Telling people who you want to be, not what you were.  Brand yourself.  Speak to future boss.  Skills must appeal to future boss.

Might want to adjust - objective to better reflect targeted job.
"Better understand the world thru data" is more like a social benefcial.  Companies want to make money.

Need relevant to irrelevant ratio.  Economy of information.

Don't use acronyms which only mean something to your current boss.

Frame bullet points for next hiring manager.

Do not use like, other, etc. as terms - discloses that you might not understand or did the project.

Talking about results means you care about results, but needs to be relevant to future boss.  Contextualize  vs company or industry.

For data analytics, need to relate to:
* Data collection and cleaning
* Reporting
* Optimization
* Modeling
* Chasing down data / solving problems

Look at the job posting RFP and adapt your resume to that.

Need to have hard skills in this world, and need to list them and point them out.  Needs to be relevant to the future job, not the current job.  Cut the noise.

Key thing you want to convey in top section is that you are qualified and better than the next guy.  Distinguish yourself from classmates who have done the same projects.
