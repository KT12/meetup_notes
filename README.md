# Meet Up Notes

This repo exists to catalog typed and transcribed notes from Meetups and events I have attended.  By keeping notes, I want to be able to look back on the most salient points made in the presentations.  I also hope others that were unable to attend can benefit by reading these notes and viewing slides.

Topics covered include [big data](https://github.com/KT12/meetup_notes/blob/master/nyc_big_data_NLP_h20.md), [machine learning](https://github.com/KT12/meetup_notes/blob/master/NHDS_healthcare_fraud_detection.md), [Python](https://github.com/KT12/meetup_notes/blob/master/nypython.md), [SQL](https://github.com/KT12/meetup_notes/blob/master/ny_sql.md), and [programming](https://github.com/KT12/meetup_notes/blob/master/philly_pug_fizz_buzz.md).

Thank you to [Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) for organizing many of these events.  I hope in the future, with better voice recognition software, that this repo will become obsolete!
