# Meet Up Notes

This repo exists to catalog typed and transcribed notes from Meetups and events I have attended.  I hope others that were unable to attend can benefit by reading these notes and viewing slides from the presentations.

Topics covered include big data, machine learning, Python, SQL, and programming.

Thank you to Meetup.com for organizing these events.  I hope in the future, with better voice recognition software, that this repo will become obsolete!
